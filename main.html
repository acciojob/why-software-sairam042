	<h1>Why I want to become a developer?</h1>
	<p>Of course, it was which is why I had my doubts. Since my background wasn’t really in software engineering, I struggled day in and day out. It was always an uphill battle to enter this field and make myself known and secure a good position. However, if anything, this experience has taught me the significance of struggle and perseverance. In hindsight, I realize that transitioning to software engineering was a good decision. It’s what makes me happy. It’s thrown light on the fact that if you are not happy with your career choice, it’s important to introspect, even when you struggle to do so. Going through this uncomfortable process can help you rediscover your passion.
	As I became a senior software engineer (Project Lead), my roles and responsibilities had more to do with building and maintaining client relationships. It’s about staying in touch with clients, understanding their issues, and problem-solving together. Other than that, I handle core responsibilities such as maintaining the quality of code, working on first-level testing, and Contentstack related work activities. Other than this, there are specific Project Lead responsibilities such as managing code standards, conducting interviews, introducing new technologies to the team, and onboarding new members to Design, Front End Development, and Email Development teams. </p>
